/**
 * A burglar is robbing a series of houses and wants to maximize his return, but knows that if he ever robs 
 * two houses directly next to each other the police will catch him. Write an algorithm to help the robber decide which houses 
 * to rob from.
 *
 * Input: Array of positive integers
 * Output: Integer
 * Constraints:
 *   - Time: O(n)
 *   - Space: no constraints
 *
 * Examples:
 *   - [5, 25, 15, 30] --> 55
 *   - [45, 10, 20, 60] --> 105
